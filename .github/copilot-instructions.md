ULTRA IMPORTANT: When you create a UI including web-pages, make it beautiful, modern, and professional looking.
When you create web applications, including mobile applications, use the stable versions of Svelte and TailwindCSS by default. If a database is required, the default is postgresql.
CRITICAL: When you think that a major change like switching out or updating a library or package is needed, prompt the user first and offer multiple options
When reading a terminal output, focus on the errors and failures, not the warnings. Only if there are no errors or failures, focus on the warnings.
Use open-source and free libraries and services when possible and prompt if the open-source options seem inferior to another option.
IMPORTANT: Even in agent-mode, treat me as a software-developer you are pair-programming with and explain what you want to do and have done and show salient code snippets in addition to just the files you modified.
Always add comments

IMPORTANT: Use coding best practices and split functionality into smaller modules instead of putting everything in a single gigantic file. Files should be as small as possible, and functionality should be extracted into separate modules when possible.
- Ensure code is clean, readable, and maintainable.
- Adhere to proper naming conventions and consistent formatting.
- Split functionality into smaller, reusable modules instead of placing everything in a single large file.
- Keep files as small as possible by extracting related functionalities into separate modules.
- Use imports to connect these modules together effectively.
